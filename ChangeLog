	* src/gslice.cc (main): when no file name was specified, and
	lengths and strides parameter were given, gslice reads from stdin.

	* src/slice.cc (main): when no file name was specified, slice
	reads from stdin.

	* src/statistics.cc (main): when no file name was specified,
	statistics reads from stdin.

	* src/vcat.cc (main): when no file name was specified,
	vcat reads from stdin.

	* src/vectorize.cc (main): when no file name was specified,
	vectorize reads from stdin.  (Now you don't have to remember
	giving '-' parameter for reading from stdin.)

	* src/Makefile.am (include_PROGRAMS): make install now installs
	vec++.h.

	* src/vec++.hh (vector_loader): new class vector_loader added.
	The following new function templates and class templates were
	added via src/vec++.hh.
	Class:
	- template <typename real> class vector_loader;
	Functors:
	- class string_to_string;
	- class string_to_int;
	- class string_to_dobule;
	Functions:
	- template <typename T, typename C> void
	  parse_multiple_parameters(std::valarrayT> **v, C converter, char *s);

	* src/vec++.h: short-cut names for vec.c added for C++ users.
	Since C++ users can have an advantage of funciton overload,
	we can offer shorter names of functions provided in vec.c.
	Header src/vec++.h defines short-cuts to those functions in vec.c.

	* src/*: refinement of codes.
	All codes that used to have .cxx suffixes have now .cc suffixes.
